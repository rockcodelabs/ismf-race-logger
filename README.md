## Architecture Overview

The app uses a **Hanami-Hybrid Architecture** — Rails 8.1 structured with Hanami 2.x conventions using dry-rb gems.

```
Request → Controller → Operation → Repo → Database
               ↓           ↓
         Broadcaster    Struct
               ↓           ↓
             Part     ← Factory
               ↓
           Template
```

**Key layers:**
- `app/models/` — Thin ActiveRecord
- `app/db/repos/` — Data access (returns structs)
- `app/db/structs/` — Immutable domain objects
- `app/operations/` — Business logic (dry-monads)
- `app/web/controllers/` — Thin HTTP adapters
- `app/web/parts/` — Presentation decorators
- `app/broadcasters/` — Real-time Turbo Streams

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for full details.
